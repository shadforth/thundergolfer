I'm here a lot, building data-intensive products from the ground up. 
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

* 🌿💚 [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see below)
* good old-fashioned books 📖. Two recent favourites are [_Dune_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune) and [_Constructing The Political Spectacle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348524.Constructing_the_Political_Spectacle)
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.

#### Active Projects

> ⚠️ I am currently quite busy at work so my active projects are getting a bit neglected. My apologies to all who use my open-source projects. I will be back.

* Growing Python in the Bazel ecosystem. See various projects in my pins. I currently do maintenance duty for [bazelbuild/**rules_python**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python).
* **[whitelist.sh](https://whitelist.sh/)** - A goal-oriented, calendar aware content feed that I would have wanted to use during my undergrad. 👷🏻‍♂️ _WIP_

Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating, It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future—it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from]. - _Alan Kay_
