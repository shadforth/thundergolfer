I'm here a lot, building data-intensive products from the ground up. 
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

* 🌿💚 [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see below)
* good old-fashioned books 📖. Two recent favourites are [_The Road To Wigan Pier_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30553.The_Road_to_Wigan_Pier) and [_Why We're Polarized_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49930783-why-we-re-polarized)
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/65717914). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.

> Computing is pop culture. [...] Pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating, It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future—it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from]. - _Alan Kay_
