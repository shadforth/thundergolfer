I'm here a lot, building data-intensive products from the ground up. 
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

* [modal.com](https://modal.com/)! Truly cloud-native application development. The fastest way to run code in the cloud.
* 🌿💚 [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see below)
* Good old-fashioned books 📖. Two recent favourites are [_The Dispossessed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed) and [_Coders at Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713575-coders-at-work).
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming. (Not the SBF/FTX-style embarassment)

#### Active Projects

* Writing about software. I semi-regularly publish a post at [**thundergolfer.com/blog**](https://thundergolfer.com/blog). A few are...
   * [_From Data Engineer to SysAdmin: Put down the K8s cluster, your pipelines can run without it_](https://thundergolfer.com/kubernetes/infrastructure/data-engineering/2021/11/04/from-data-eng-to-sys-admin-put-down-k8s/)
   * [_What's in a name? The Data Scientist vs. Machine Learning Engineer title bore._](https://thundergolfer.com/machine-learning/communication/career/2021/10/30/the-ds-vs-mle-title-bore/)
   * [_A Basic Python Toolchain in Bazel_](https://thundergolfer.com/bazel/python/2021/06/25/a-basic-python-bazel-toolchain/)
* Growing Python in the Bazel ecosystem. See various projects in my pins. I currently do maintenance duty for [bazelbuild/**rules_python**](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python).
* **[whitelist.sh](https://whitelist.sh/)** - A goal-oriented, calendar aware content feed that I would have wanted to use during my undergrad. 👷🏻‍♂️ _WIP_
* **[ddiaflashcards.com](ddiaflashcards.com)** - Building a study deck for a much loved software textbook. A small digital product, available for 🥜 $$.

> Computing is pop culture. [...] Pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating, It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future—it's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from]. - _Alan Kay_
